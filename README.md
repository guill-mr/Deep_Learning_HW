# Deep_Learning_HW
Repository for the extended project in Deep Learning from the course Computational Learning and Deep Learning.

Individual work on MIMIC Database, provided in a limited form by the professor to provide a better working environment regarding the scope of the project. Project specifically focused on working and optimizing both Neural Network and Ensemble models for LOS (Length Of Stay), no other models were to be considered for this specific project.

Tailored the project to suit a Kaggle competition format (with people from within the class only), which I got really good results in.
